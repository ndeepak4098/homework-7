# homework-7
These are all of my files for homework 7.
The first and second file basically looks into Text blob and some of the features. The third file takes in a file, and will give a paraphrased version of the same paragraph, using different features. 
The fourth file analyzes movies, and can predict whether a movie review was good or bad based on context clues for up to a 60% accuracy.
